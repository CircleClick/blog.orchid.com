We are thrilled to announce that the community will soon be able to earn the Orchid digital asset, OXT, through CoinMarketCap's [Earn Campaign](https://coinmarketcap.com/earn/). Orchid has partnered with CoinMarketCap -- the leading provider of real-time market data on digital assets -- as part of its "Learn Crypto, Earn Crypto" program. 

According to CoinMarketCap, the idea behind the campaign is to incentivize people to educate themselves about certain crypto assets and decentralized applications. The program follows an earlier OXT campaign on Coinbase. Customers on the largest U.S. exchange earned OXT simply by learning about the token and taking a few quizzes.

> "CoinMarketCap is the gold standard for real-time market information in the digital asset space," said Orchid CEO Dr. Steven Waterhouse. "We are excited to roll out this Earn Campaign to bring more people into our digital privacy marketplace."

Orchid's unique VPN marketplace uses a robust system of incentives to match supply with demand and ensure ample bandwidth is available. Accounts are funded with OXT, which is then used to purchase VPN service on a pay-as-you-go basis. But while Orchid's digital currency is key to the functioning of the marketplace, individual users can start using Orchid in seconds using nothing more than an ordinary credit card. This innovation effectively masks the blockchain, giving users the benefits of decentralization while providing a seamless user experience.

CoinMarketCap is the world's most-referenced price-tracking website for cryptoassets with a mission to empower retail users with unbiased, high quality and accurate information for drawing their own informed conclusions.
