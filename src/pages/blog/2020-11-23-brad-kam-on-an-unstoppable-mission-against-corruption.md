[Brad Kam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradley-kam-444aa228/), co-founder of [Unstoppable Domain](https://twitter.com/unstoppableweb?lang=en), fell down the crypto rabbit hole in a hacker house in San Francisco that was so rundown the hallways made a perfect set for filming horror movies. But that inauspicious start was where Brad had his epiphany and realized crypto was the best way to fight corruption.

Brad's earlier studies of international politics, particularly in the Middle East, exposed him to the theory that countries rich in natural resources were sadly destined to create anti-democratic systems.

> "If your government has a whole bunch of resources, then you are not going to have democracy because they don't need their citizens," Brad said on the latest episode of the [Follow the White Rabbit](https://www.orchid.com/podcast/episode-21-felipe-erazo) podcast. "This leads to anti-democracy and it's all a problem to do with assets being physical and some group of people being able to just go and grab them from other people."

Brad found he had a passion to rid the world of corruption that was only matched by his frustration at the lack of any political solution.

Still, in that 20Mission building in San Francisco where he lived for five years from 2012, Brad mingled with cryptocurrency fanatics, including the likes of Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin holding forth in the courtyard.

> "When I saw crypto, I thought to myself: 'Wow. This is actually a solution to the corruption problem.' If you have user-owned assets that are digital, all of a sudden you can't have some giant government or some military or whatever just go and take stuff. It completely changed the balance that has existed in politics. That was the most hopeful thing I'd ever seen and I just couldn't take my mind off it."

At Unstoppable Domains, which replaces complicated cryptocurrency addresses with a human readable name, Brad has set about leveraging blockchain technology to help wrest control from centralized censors who have made the "messed up" modern-day Internet.
