OXT, the Orchid token, is now listed on [Upbit](https://upbit.com/), the largest digital asset exchange in South Korea, as Orchid expands further across Asia and the globe. Equipped with world-class technology, regulatory expertise, and operational know-how, Upbit currently operates exchanges in South Korea, Singapore, and Indonesia.

New users can open an Orchid account by purchasing at least $4 in OXT and $1 of ETH on Upbit. Once the account is created, a shareable QR code will appear that contains account credentials. Anyone can copy or scan that account into the app for a simple, one-step setup.

Orchid's unique VPN marketplace uses a robust system of incentives to match supply with demand and ensure ample bandwidth is available. People use OXT to fund their account, and can then purchase VPN service on a pay-as-you-go basis.

Dr. Steven Waterhouse, Orchid's Co-Founder and CEO said: "We are thrilled with this new listing, which reflects Orchid's strong global expansion, including across Asia. Upbit is a leading outlet for cryptocurrencies in Asia, particularly in the vibrant crypto community in Korea. We're excited that people can now use Upbit to get OXT and explore the Internet more freely."

Established in 2017 by Dunamu Inc., Upbit has grown to be South Korea's largest exchange and has expanded across the Asia-Pacific region to include Singapore and Indonesia. Last month, Upbit announced that Upbit Thailand received approval for four provisional licenses to operate digital asset-related businesses in Thailand by the country's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
