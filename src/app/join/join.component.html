        <h3 class="join-step__title color-gray">Buy OXT on <a href="https://www.coinbase.com">Coinbase</a></h3>
        <p>You need OXT tokens to pay network providers for bandwidth. OXT is available on <a href="https://www.coinbase.com">Coinbase</a> and elsewhere. Most users need 20 USD worth of OXT for 3 months of usage.</p>
        <p>Remember: You only pay for the bandwidth you use.</p>
        <p>Once you buy the OXT, keep the Coinbase window open as you will need to send those funds to a wallet in the next step.</p>

        <h3 class="join-step__title color-gray">Set up a Web3 enabled wallet</h3>
        <p>For your privacy, Orchid does not use a standard email and password for authentication. Instead, the fact that you own the wallet that funds your account authenticates you in the system. You need a Web3-enabled wallet app to use Orchid, such as <a href="https://wallet.coinbase.com/">Coinbase Wallet</a>. If you already have a wallet, please skip to step C.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, here are your steps:</p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Download and install a <a href="https://wallet.coinbase.com/">Web3 enabled wallet application</a></li>
          <li>Once in the wallet, find the Ethereum address to receive funds and copy it to your clipboard (There is slight variance between apps, typically you tap on “receive” and then the Ethereum icon)</li>
          <li>Switch over to your Coinbase account</li>
          <li>Send the OXT you purchased to your Ethereum address</li>
          <li>Send $1-$2 of ETH to your Ethereum address (This is to cover gas costs)</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="join-step step-3">
        <div class="join-step__number">3</div>
        <h3 class="join-step__title color-gray">Create and fund an Orchid account</h3>
        <p>Your gateway to funding Orchid is found at account.orchid.com. Here, funds can be transferred between your wallet and Orchid. This would include: topping off your funds when they run low, setting up the account to start, and removing the funds at any time.</p>
        <p>Follow these steps to create and fund your Orchid account:</p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>In your Web3 wallet, navigate to the DApp browser</li>
          <li>Enter <b>account.orchid.com</b> into the URL bar</li>
          <li>Bookmark the page to find it again easily</li>
          <li>Tap on the button to fund your account</li>
          <li>Here, there are three fields to fill in (You will retrieve the signer key from the 	Orchid app in the next step, so leave that blank for now)</li>
          <li>Enter 50 OXT in the balance field</li>
          <li>Enter 10 OXT in the deposit field</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Now you will retrieve your signer key from the Orchid app.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="join-step step-4">
        <div class="join-step__number">4</div>
        <h3 class="join-step__title color-gray">Download and link the Orchid app</h3>
        <p>The Orchid app is where you manage your private path to the Internet by constructing custom “hops” on our new VPN platform. To fund your hops, you will need to connect them to your funding source via your Orchid account.</p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Download the app from the <a href="#">Apple App Store</a> or <a href="#">Google Play</a></li>
          <li>Open the app and go to the “Hops” tab on the bottom right</li>
          <li>Tap the “+” button to create a new hop</li>
          <li>Tap “Orchid Hop” to create a new hop on the Orchid Network</li>
          <li>Paste your Ethereum address (from Step 2) into the “Wallet address” field</li>
          <li>To the right of the “Signer key” field, tap the “+” icon</li>
          <li>Tap the “Generate key” button and then tap “Save” in the top right</li>
          <li>Tap on your new “Orchid hop” to open the hop settings screen and tap the 	“Copy” button to copy your signer key to the clipboard</li>
          <li>Switch back to your wallet app and paste the key into the signer key field</li>
          <li>Hit the button to fund your Orchid account.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You now have a funded hop!</p>

        <div class="join-step__number">5</div>
        <h3 class="join-step__title color-gray">Start exploring freely!</h3>
        <p>On the app’s “Status” tab, tap the power button, and that’s it. You’re ready to start exploring freely.<br>
            Stay curious out there!</p>
