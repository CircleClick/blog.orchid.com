									Interview with Rich Staropoli</a>
							</h3>
							<p>
								In our premiere episode, we go down the rabbit hole with Rich Staropoli, whose career
								reads like a Tom Clancy spy novel. He's the former White House CIO for the Department of
								Homeland Security and a special agent for the Secret Service for 25 years. He discusses
								what it was like to protect President George W. Bush on September 11th, his thoughts on
								the current state of technology at DHS, what cybersecurity risks our country faces, and
								the future of our election systems.

					<h2>About the Host</h2>
					<p>

						Alex Kehaya is the host for Follow the White Rabbit and the Head of Business Development
						for Orchid Labs. He’s an entrepreneur, educator, and investor who began his career as
						one of the first educators to teach lean startup and market validation techniques to
						high school and middle school students as part of their standard school curriculum. He
						scaled these programs to over 100 educators through a series of workshops that he ran
						with the folks behind <a class="phantom-a" href="https://kordainstitute.org/"><u>Korda Institute
								for Teaching</u></a>. Since then, he’s founded numerous
						software related companies and participated as an angel investor in multiple
						impact-focused projects.
