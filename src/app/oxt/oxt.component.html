      <p class="medium"><a href="#">The Orchid Token (OXT)</a>, is a new ERC20 compliant token used to exchange value on the Orchid network. OXT is required for users to purchase VPN service and providers receive OXT in exchange for their bandwidth. On Orchid, both users and providers stake OXT.</p>

      <p class="medium">The supply of OXT is fixed at one billion units. There is no inflation. The possibility of contractual penalty mechanisms that ‘burn’ OXT create the potential for some small deflationary pressure.</p>

      <p>Using a new custom token as the currency for the Orchid Market provides economic incentive benefits that would not be possible if we used generic currencies such as ETH.  More specifically, requiring that large providers stake large amounts of a custom utility currency specific to our market creates stronger incentive alignment effects than using a generic currency, as the provider’s behavior will more strongly affect the price of the custom market token and thus the value of their stake positions.  If we instead used a generic currency such as ETH, this correlation would be very weak, as the health of the Orchid market would have much less expected impact on the price of ETH. </p>
