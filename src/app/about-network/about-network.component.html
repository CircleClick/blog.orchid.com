	Inspired by the parts of nature that demonstrate emergent self-organization, the Orchid network—an overlay network that runs on the existing internet—is designed for a mutual exchange of benefit in a peer-to-peer marketplace.

        Orchid is an overlay network that runs on the existing internet. The network consists of relay and bridge nodes
        that stake Orchid tokens (ERC20) in order to earn fees for bandwidth. The stake keeps players in the system
        honest by serving as a decentralized reputation system. The list of nodes is stored in an Ethereum smart
        contract that is decentralized, accessible, and editable by anyone around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users connect and configure their VPN service through the app. In the backend, the application is using our
        probabilistic micropayment system to purchase bandwidth on the fly. Information is protected at each relay hop,
        providing security not seen in traditional, single hop VPN implementations. Unlike traditional VPNs, no relay or
        exit receives any customer’s personal information. Users can switch providers depending upon speed, price,
        location and availability in the marketplace. </p>
