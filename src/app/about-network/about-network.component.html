    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>
      Orchid is an overlay network that runs on the existing internet. The network consists of relay and exit nodes that stake Orchid token —-an Ethereum compatible token —- in order to earn fees for bandwidth. The stake keeps players in the system honest. The list of nodes is stored in an Ethereum smart contract that is decentralized and accessible around the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users connect and configure their VPN service through the app. In the backend, the application is using our probabilistic micropayment system to purchase bandwidth on the fly. Information is protected at each relay hop, providing security not seen in traditional, single hop VPN implementations. Users can switch providers depending upon speed, price and availability in the marketplace.
