      <p>
        Like the give and take of the natural world, the relationship between developers and users is mutually
        beneficial. With Orchid, developers finally have the ideal conditions to create a natural internet that can
        scale seamlessly through direct relationships and efficient infrastructure.

          <h3>Adaptability</h3>
          <p>
            Developers can build the internet they want to build—without worrying about shouldering the cost of the
            infrastructure. Scaling is seamless because every user contributes to the network’s shared resources.

          <h3>Harmony</h3>
          <p>
            Orchid expands the reach of developers by welcoming users from around the world. Developers can build
            relationships directly with users, who have exclusive control over their privacy and identity, creating a
            secure network of connected autonomy.

            Because the network is distributed efficiently across user-initiated servers, whatever is built with Orchid
            lasts as long as it’s needed or wanted.
